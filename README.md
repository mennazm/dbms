# dbms

Bash Shell Script Database Management System (DBMS):
The Project aim to develop DBMS, that will enable users to store and retrieve the data from Hard-disk.

The Simple DBMS is a command-line database management system implemented in Bash. It provides basic functionalities to create, drop, and use databases, as well as create, drop, and manipulate tables within databases. Users can interact with the system through a series of text-based menus.


Features:

Create, drop, and use databases
Create, drop, and manipulate tables within databases
Insert data into tables
Delete data from tables
Update data in tables
Select and display data from tables.

To add a GUI to the Simple DBMS project, we can use a simple GUI toolkit for Bash called dialog. Dialog provides a way to create text-based interfaces with buttons, menus, input boxes, and more. We'll integrate dialog into the existing Bash script to replace the text-based menus with graphical ones.

Install Dialog:
sudo apt-get install dialog
